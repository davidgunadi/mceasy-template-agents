## Folder structure

```
your-repo/
├── CLAUDE.md                          # Project instructions — agents read this for context
├── README.md                          # This file
├── .gitignore
├── outputs/                           # All generated files go here

    │   └── example-agent.md
    └── skills/                        # One folder per slash command
        └── example-skill/
            └── SKILL.md
```

## How agents work

Each file in `.claude/agents/` defines one agent. The frontmatter controls how Claude uses it:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name # How you invoke it: @agent-name
description: ... # Claude reads this to decide when to use it
model: sonnet # sonnet (fast/cheap) or opus (deep research)
tools: Read, Write # What tools the agent can use
---

[System prompt — the agent's instructions]
```

**Model guidance:**

- Use `opus` for research agents that need deep reasoning and web search
- Use `sonnet` for writing, reviewing, and formatting agents

**Tools you can grant:**

- `Read`, `Write`, `Edit` — file access
- `WebSearch`, `WebFetch` — internet access
- `Bash` — shell commands (use carefully)

---

## How skills work

Each folder in `.claude/skills/` is a slash command. The folder name becomes the command.

```
.claude/skills/my-pipeline/SKILL.md  →  /my-pipeline
```

The `SKILL.md` file is a prompt that tells Claude how to orchestrate the pipeline — which agents to invoke, in what order, and where to pause for human input.

---

## How CLAUDE.md works

`CLAUDE.md` in the repo root is always loaded as project context. Use it to:

- Define the pipeline order and rules
- Give agents shared background knowledge about your domain, product, or team
- Set hard rules (e.g. "always save to `./outputs/`", "write in English only")

Agents read `CLAUDE.md` automatically — you don't need to repeat context in every agent file.
